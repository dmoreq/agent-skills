# Technical Reporting Skill

Create a saved technical markdown document when the user asked for a durable report, benchmark write-up, or ADR file. Skip this skill for in-chat answers. Apply **Zen Minimalism** in prose rhythm, paragraph density, and structural clarity.

## When to Use
- User asked to save a report, benchmark summary, or architecture analysis as markdown
- Embedding Mermaid or SVG assets into a persistent `.md` file

## When Not to Use
- Short in-chat answers (tables in the reply are enough)
- Plotly figure construction (`data-visualization`)
- Stakeholder decision narrative (`data-storytelling`)
- Interactive dashboards (`plotly-dash`)

## Spec and Contract Handoffs
- A design spec is not a report. Use **spec-driven-design** for `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD_<feature>.md`; keep reports in `docs/reports/`. Topic and feature slugs follow the artifact slug and containment rule in `rules/AGENTS.md` §4.
- A drift report follows **codebase-contracts**. State the audited revision and name the drift vector for each row.
- When a report claims current behavior, cite a contract path or a probe. A claim with neither is unverified.
- When a report locks an architectural decision, run **doubt-driven-development** on the decision before publishing.
- A report that becomes a review handoff must satisfy **code-review** evidence rules: exact revision, executed checks, and separated findings.

## Related Skills
- Use **html-report** when the saved deliverable must be a single-file, print-ready `.html` page (`dossier`, `zen-garden`, or `chronicle`) instead of Markdown; rendered HTML follows its typography contract.
- Use **data-visualization** when embedding Plotly/SVG charts (layout and overlap QA live there).
- Use **data-storytelling** when the report carries a stakeholder decision narrative.
- Use **doubt-driven-development** when the report locks a decision rather than recording one.
- Use **code-review** when the report is an audit or remediation handoff.
- Use **codebase-contracts** when the report is a drift audit of specs or READMEs.
- Use **verify-and-stop** to confirm the decisive check and terminate.
- Numbers come from the skill that produced them; do not chain research to optimization to report.

## 1. Execution Flow
1. **Inspect the destination**: read repository instructions and existing docs layout; identify the current revision and dirty-tree scope for code reports.
2. **Prepare evidence**: distinguish executed results, static findings, recommendations, and unresolved decisions. Generate chart assets only when they improve the report.
3. **Draft the markdown** using verified numbers and repository-relative source references. Relocate symbols before relying on historical line numbers.
4. **Embed assets**, when needed, with relative paths from the report file.
5. **Validate the deliverable**: check enumerated IDs/counts, referenced repository paths, and code fences. Do not rerun runtime tests for a documentation-only handoff.

## 2. File Organization & Naming
- Prefix persistent files with ISO date: `YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`.
- Topic slugs follow the artifact slug and containment rule in `rules/AGENTS.md` §4.
- Workspace default: match existing docs layout, else `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`.
- Session default: host artifact directory if the environment provides one; otherwise `docs/reports/`.
- Assets: `docs/reports/assets/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>/` or beside the report. Always relative paths.

## 3. Mermaid (in-document diagrams)
- Supported headers only: `xychart-beta`, `flowchart TD` / `flowchart LR` / `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`, `classDiagram`.
- Keep sketches compact (3-5 nodes). No HTML inside nodes.
- Architecture / EDA charts that need real axes: export SVG via `data-visualization` (Plotly) or, if the repo already uses them, Seaborn/Matplotlib. Infrastructure diagrams: `diagrams` (Mingrammer). Decision trees / state machines: `graphviz`.
- Prefer `.svg`; PNG only when SVG cannot be produced. Do not embed raw HTML or iframes.

## 4. Content & Zen Minimalism Prose Standards
- Start with `TL;DR` / Executive Summary (metrics + takeaway in 1-2 declarative sentences).
- Inherit global communication invariants (`AGENTS.md` §1): zero fluff, table preferences, and plain-text/Unicode math over LaTeX.
- **Kanso (Essentialist Wording)**: Cut filler intros, hedging, and ornamental adjectives. Lead every section with the conclusion and exact metric (`<= 20 words` per sentence target).
- **Ma (Paragraph Breathing Room)**: Keep paragraphs strictly at **2-3 sentences** (`<= 60 words`). Break up dense explanations into markdown tables or parallel bullet lists so each block has cognitive breathing room.
- **Shibumi (Understated Evidence Honesty)**: Let exact counts, revision hashes, and probe commands carry authority. Never use hype superlatives.
- Charts only when they reveal a pattern a table would hide.
- When a claim in an earlier version of the same document turns out to be wrong, open with a **retraction section before anything else**: state the claim, the probe that produced it, the mechanism that made the probe wrong, and the corrected measurement. Patching the wrong sentence silently and keeping the same title leaves a document whose conclusion cannot be trusted; the reader needs to see which statement was withdrawn.
- Every measured row carries its harvesting command next to the number. A figure without the command that produced it is a reading from memory, and the next session cannot reproduce or falsify it.
- Keep projections visibly separate from measurements - label a projected capture size or wall clock as an estimate and say which measured value it was scaled from.

## Implementation Handoffs

- A proposal or plan is a report too. Honor an explicit plan-mode target path over the `docs/reports/` default; in plan mode, write only that plan file and perform no implementation, mutating commands, or commits. Otherwise save in the owning repo's `docs/reports/`. State that the plan authorizes no code, data, or commit yet.
- For a remediation handoff to an implementer without context, enumerate every reviewed finding and separate actionable defects from unproven cleanup. Give each behavior change an exact file, complete test and minimal patch, expected RED failure and GREEN result, targeted verification command, and commit boundary. Use a characterization check instead of fabricating a failing test for deletion of unreachable code.
- Every defect claim in a plan carries the measurement next to it (the count, the rank boundary, the probe result) or is marked as a static reading. A plan that asserts "the current artifact is dirty" without the observed numbers is not verifiable by the implementer.
- Make accept criteria executable: name each verification check, its pass condition, and the command that produces it. Add an explicit "if a check fails, report the failure instead of adjusting the gate to make it pass" instruction - self-tightening thresholds to reach a target count is the recurring failure in gated selection work.
- End with one block of open decisions, each with the default taken if the user does not answer.
- When the user asks another agent to implement an analysis, save an actionable handoff rather than merely copying the conversation. Include source evidence, invariants, small work packages, acceptance tests, data/product blockers, and a copy-ready agent prompt.
- Record approved names, default configurations, supported combinations, and explicitly deferred combinations before defining work packages. Remove superseded proposals from the implementation instructions so the next agent does not implement competing APIs.
- Assign each non-trivial work package a corresponding independent specialist reviewer and require principal-level review of architectural boundaries. Put reviewer specialties, acceptance evidence, and unresolved-review blockers in the package itself and the copy-ready prompt; a generic final "review code" step is insufficient.
- Include focused naming/YAGNI cleanup in the migration scope, but separate mechanical moves, redundancy removal, and behavior changes. Preserve legacy imports and wire/fixture identifiers until consumer evidence supports removal.
- Identify the dirty-tree baseline and pre-existing edits; a commit hash alone does not describe reviewed uncommitted code.
- Separate immediately actionable correctness fixes from conditional redesign and calibration. A backlog is not authorization to implement every item or remove curated behavior.
- Label previous test results with their scope and snapshot; do not sum overlapping runs or imply that historical passes verify future edits.
- Finish with the saved path and a short content summary, not another full inline report.
