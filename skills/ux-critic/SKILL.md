# UX Critic Skill

Review the rendered interface as a hostile design director. Find what is weak, missing, cluttered, or dishonest before a user does. Enforce **Zen Minimalism** (*Kanso* essentialism, *Ma* breathing room, *Shibumi* understated authority) alongside Dieter Rams and Nielsen. Do not edit code.

## When to Use
- After `ui-accessibility` passes and the screen is ready for a design review.
- When asked to critique, review, or elevate an existing interface.
- When a screen feels cluttered, flat, confusing, or off-brand.
- Before a stakeholder demo or a release candidate review.
- An executive or decision report rendered as a single-file HTML page (`dossier`, `zen-garden`, or `chronicle`).

## When Not to Use
- Implementation or code changes (`html-report`, `plotly-dash`, `python-pro`).
- Token, typography, or component generation (`design-system`).
- WCAG conformance audit (`ui-accessibility`).
- Decision or spec review before UI exists (`doubt-driven-development`).
- Code correctness, security, or performance (`code-review`).

## Artifact Path
- Critique report: `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD_ux-critique_<topic>.md`.
- Screenshots live beside the report or in the host artifact directory.
- Never write an undated file at the repository root.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Evidence
1. Capture desktop and mobile screenshots at shipping viewports.
2. Read the product brief and the design system spec.
3. Confirm the accessibility gate has passed or record that it has not.
4. If screenshots are unavailable, stop and request them. Do not critique from source code alone.

### Step 2: Run the Six-Dimension Audit
The full dimension table, heuristic mapping, and steering commands are in `references/heuristic-critique.md`.

| Dimension | Question | Failure signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Focal point and squint test | Is the primary metric or action unmistakable within two seconds? | Four equal-weight cards compete; the eye lands on decoration |
| Spatial rhythm and *Ma* alignment | Is macro whitespace larger than micro whitespace? Are alignment axes unified? | Inverted rhythm; mixed left edges; cramped groups without breathing room |
| State honesty | Does empty guide, loading preserve geometry, and error explain recovery? | Loading looks disabled; empty state has no next step |
| Microcopy, *Kanso* wording, and paragraph rhythm | Are labels declarative and specific? Are paragraphs `2-3 sentences` (`<= 60 words`) with zero fluff? | "Submit", "Something went wrong", dense wall-of-text paragraphs, hype superlatives |
| Mode fit and *Shibumi* restraint | Does the visual ambition match the Surface Mode without shouting? | A brand hero inside an operations console; cold harsh `#0000FF` or neon accents |
| YAGNI and signifier honesty | Did an unrequested widget, decorative icon, or vanity metric appear? Are controls recognizable without hover? | Hallucinated chrome; ghost buttons; false minimalism |

### Step 3: Apply Dieter Rams, Zen Minimalism, and Nielsen
Before Nielsen, score the screen against five Rams principles and three Zen Minimalism tenets:
- **#4 Good design is understandable**: the primary action is obvious without a manual.
- **#5 Unobtrusive (*Shibumi*)**: decoration and color never shout or compete with the task.
- **#6 Honest**: states and affordances do not overpromise.
- **#8 Thorough down to the last detail**: alignment, states, tabular numerals, and edge cases are complete.
- **#10 Less, but better (*Kanso* & *Ma*)**: remove non-essential elements and prose filler before you add; preserve purposeful emptiness around focal insights.

Then apply Nielsen's Ten Heuristics:
Evaluate each heuristic against the screenshots and record evidence:
1. Visibility of system status.
2. Match between system and the real world.
3. User control and freedom.
4. Consistency and standards.
5. Error prevention.
6. Recognition rather than recall.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.
10. Help and documentation.

A heuristic that does not apply is marked `Not applicable`, not `Pass`.

### Step 4: Run the Mandatory Subtraction Pass
Run subtraction before any polish:
1. `distill` (*Kanso*): remove badges, decorative icons, redundant subtitles, outer borders, and prose filler until removing one more item would break task comprehension. Split or trim any paragraph outside the 2-3 sentence band.
2. `quieter` (*Shibumi* & *Ma*): replace harsh pure white/black or cold saturated surfaces with warm organic paper/stone tones; reduce chroma on secondary metadata and gridlines; expand macro section whitespace.
3. `clarify`: replace vague labels with verb-noun microcopy and lead sections with a declarative metric thesis.
4. `polish`: align baselines, optical padding, and 100-180ms ease-out transitions.

Use `bolder` or `harden` only after subtraction, when hierarchy or resilience still needs work.

| Command | Intent | Example action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `distill` | Remove noise (*Kanso*) | Drop redundant badges, decorative borders, duplicate labels; trim paragraphs to `2-3 sentences` |
| `bolder` | Strengthen hierarchy | Increase the hero metric to 3x body size; sharpen the focal contrast |
| `quieter` | Reduce aggression (*Shibumi* / *Ma*) | Soften saturated surfaces into warm organic neutrals; expand section breathing room |
| `clarify` | Improve meaning | Rename "Submit" to "Create workspace"; open with the exact delta thesis |
| `polish` | Align craft | Harmonize radii, baselines, spacing, and transition timing |
| `harden` | Improve resilience | Cover overflow, long strings, slow loading, and partial data |

### Step 5: Write the Critique
The report contains:
- Scope, revision, viewports, and evidence paths.
- A two-sentence verdict.
- `Keep`: 1-2 elements that already exemplify "less, but better".
- Findings ordered by severity, each with the dimension, heuristic, evidence, and the steering command.
- `**THE ONE DELETION**`: the single highest-leverage element, wrapper, or control to remove completely.
- A prioritized fix list. Do not edit the code.
- A final ship recommendation: `Ship`, `Ship with fixes`, or `Do not ship`.

## Rules
- Critique the rendered result, not the author.
- Do not invent metrics or screenshots. If evidence is missing, request it.
- Do not propose a redesign when a targeted steering command fixes the issue.
- Do not polish before the subtraction pass.
- Name exactly one `**THE ONE DELETION**` in every critique.
- Do not contradict the product brief's Surface Mode.
- Do not override an accessibility failure with a visual preference.
- Do not accept false minimalism: missing signifiers, focus, labels, or states.
- Use `Critical`, `Important`, `Suggestion`, and `Nit`; no emoji.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Desktop and mobile screenshots are available.
- [ ] Product brief and design system are read.
- [ ] All six dimensions are evaluated, including *Kanso* wording, *Ma* spacing, and YAGNI signifier honesty.
- [ ] The five Rams principles are checked.
- [ ] All ten heuristics are marked Pass, Fail, or Not applicable.
- [ ] The subtraction pass ran before polish.
- [ ] Every finding names a steering command.
- [ ] `**THE ONE DELETION**` is named.
- [ ] The report uses an ISO-dated path under `docs/reports/`.
- [ ] The ship recommendation is explicit.

## Related Skills
- Use **html-report** when the critique targets a single-file report; this critique is a blocking gate for executive reports, so review desktop, mobile, and print screenshots across `dossier`, `zen-garden`, or `chronicle` and return `Ship`, `Ship with fixes`, or `Do not ship`.
- Use **ux-product-shaper** for the Surface Mode and 8-state contract the critique must respect.
- Use **design-system** for token, component, and responsive rules behind the findings.
- Use **ui-accessibility** before this critique; accessibility failures block visual polish.
- Use **doubt-driven-development** when a finding challenges a product or architecture decision.
- Use **verify-and-stop** for the decisive final check and stop.
