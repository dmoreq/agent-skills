# Flutter and Dart Testing and Verification Strategy

## Summary

Build reliable, deterministic tests across Unit, Widget, Golden/Accessibility, and Integration levels. Favor lightweight in-memory Fakes over brittle Mocks for application-owned repositories, inject deterministic clocks/dependencies, and verify every UI change across compact and expanded viewports.

## When to Use

- Writing unit tests for Repositories, Services, ViewModels, Notifiers, or Cubits
- Writing widget tests (`testWidgets`) to verify UI states (loading, empty, error, data) and user interactions
- Fixing flaky async tests (`pump` vs `pumpAndSettle`, fake timers, unclosed streams)
- Adding accessibility guideline assertions (`meetsGuideline`) or multi-viewport layout overflow checks
- Setting up E2E flows with `integration_test` or `patrol`

## Steps

### 1. Prefer Fakes Over Mocks for Owned Boundaries

Follow the official Flutter Architecture testing recommendation:

- **Create reusable `Fake<T>Repository` classes**: Implement your abstract `UserRepository` interface with an in-memory `FakeUserRepository` that stores a list/map and simulates configurable success or `AppFailure` responses. Fakes test real input/output contracts rather than brittle internal method call sequences.
- **When Mocks are needed**: For low-level third-party SDKs or verifying specific side-effect calls, use `mocktail` (zero codegen) or `mockito` (`@GenerateNiceMocks`).
- **Make time deterministic**: Never call `DateTime.now()` directly inside domain or ViewModel logic; use `clock.now()` from `package:clock` so unit tests can run inside `withClock(Clock.fixed(...), () { ... })`.

### 2. Write Thorough Unit Tests for Data and Logic Layers

Structure unit tests in `test/` mirroring the `lib/` folder path (`test/features/auth/ui/login_view_model_test.dart`):

- Follow the **Arrange - Act - Assert** structure inside descriptive `group()` and `test()` blocks.
- Test all branches of `Result<T>`: happy path data transformation, empty payload handling, network/server error mapping, and edge-case inputs.
- For Riverpod providers, create a scoped `ProviderContainer(overrides: [...])` with `addTearDown(container.dispose)` in a helper function.
- For Bloc/Cubit, use `blocTest<MyCubit, MyState>()` from `package:bloc_test` to assert state emission sequences cleanly.

### 3. Build a Reusable `pumpApp` Harness for Widget Tests

Eliminate boilerplate in `testWidgets` by creating a `pumpApp` extension on `WidgetTester` (see `references/test-harness-templates.md`):

- Wrap the widget under test in `MaterialApp` (including `localizationsDelegates`, `supportedLocales`, and `AppTheme.light`) and required DI providers (`ProviderScope` / `MultiBlocProvider`).
- **Find widgets by semantics, keys, or types**: Prefer `find.bySemanticsLabel(...)`, `find.text(...)`, `find.byKey(...)`, or `find.byType(...)` over fragile tree index lookups.
- **Understand `pump()` vs `pumpAndSettle()`**:
  - Use `await tester.pump()` to advance a single frame (e.g., to assert that a `CircularProgressIndicator` appears while an async request is pending).
  - Use `await tester.pumpAndSettle()` only when animations have finite completion. Calling `pumpAndSettle()` while an infinite indeterminate spinner (`CircularProgressIndicator`) is on screen will time out!

### 4. Test Responsive Breakpoints and Accessibility Guidelines

Catch layout overflows and a11y regressions automatically in widget tests:

- Test key screens at both compact phone width (`Size(375, 667)` with `textScaleFactor: 1.5`) and expanded tablet/desktop width (`Size(1024, 768)`) using `tester.view.physicalSize` and `addTearDown(tester.view.resetPhysicalSize)`.
- Run Flutter's built-in accessibility checks on critical screens:
  - `await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(androidTapTargetGuideline));`
  - `await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(labeledTapTargetGuideline));`
  - `await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(textContrastGuideline));`

### 5. Run Verification Gates

Always run tests and static analysis before declaring a task complete:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test --randomize-ordering-seed=random
```

To collect test coverage and generate an `lcov.info` report:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

## Gotchas

- **`pumpAndSettle` timing out**: Almost always caused by an infinite animation (`CircularProgressIndicator`, shimmer skeleton, or repeating `AnimationController`). Use `await tester.pump(const Duration(milliseconds: 100))` instead.
- **HttpOverrides in widget tests**: By default, `flutter_test` blocks all real HTTP traffic and returns `400 Bad Request` for `Image.network`. Either wrap image loading behind an injectable image provider or use `mocktail_image_network` in widget tests.
- **Shared mutable state across tests**: Never share a mutable `FakeRepository` instance across multiple `test()` blocks without resetting it inside `setUp()`.

## Related Skills
- Use **flutter-architecture-data** when testing repositories, services, or ViewModels.
- Use **flutter-state-management** when testing Notifiers, Cubits, or provider wiring.
- Use **dart-modern-idioms** when Dart async safety or pattern matching affects test structure.
- Use **verify-and-stop** for the decisive verification command before declaring completion.
- Use **flutter-performance-optimization** when frame-time or memory tests need dedicated performance assertions.
