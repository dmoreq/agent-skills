# Python Performance Optimization Skill

Find and fix real performance problems. Measure first.

Load `references/implementation-playbook.md` **only** for a named profiler recipe (`cProfile`, `py-spy`, `tracemalloc`, `scalene`). Do not load it for process or policy.

## When to Use
- Slow Python execution, high latency, CPU saturation, or excessive memory RSS
- Data-processing, I/O, or database access that is measurably expensive
- Before/after benchmarking of an optimization or container change

## When Not to Use
- No evidence of a performance problem
- Quality KPIs (accuracy, F1, Hit@K) → **algorithm-optimization**
- Standard Polars/DuckDB query authoring → **polars-duckdb**
- Premature micro-optimization off the critical path

## Related Skills
- Use **polars-duckdb** when migrating slow Pandas/Python loops to vectorized Polars or DuckDB.
- Use **python-concurrency** when the bottleneck is I/O wait or needs multi-core CPU parallelism.
- Use **pyo3-maturin** when a confirmed CPU hotspot cannot be accelerated further in Python.
- Use **algorithm-optimization** for quality KPIs on real cases, not runtime.

## Core Principles
1. Measure first — never optimize from guesses.
2. Fix the actual hotspot, not the whole codebase.
3. Simple readable fixes and container/representation upgrades before rewrites.
4. Re-measure after each meaningful change in a clean process.
5. Stop when the target is met.

## Optimization Process

### 1. Clarify Goals
Latency, CPU, peak RSS memory, or throughput? Numeric target? Constraints (Python version, dependencies, architecture freeze)?

### 2. Profile with Rigor
- **CPU / runtime**: `py-spy` (non-intrusive sampling for live processes), `cProfile` (deterministic), `scalene`
- **Memory**: `memray` (tracks native C and Python heap allocations, generates flamegraphs), `scalene`, `tracemalloc`
- **Line-level**: `line_profiler`

Use `time.perf_counter` / `timeit`, never `time.time()`. Warm lazy caches, time dataset I/O and compute separately on the same bounded rows, then use `cProfile` or `py-spy` to locate hot calls. Re-time a wrapped hotspot without deterministic profiling before quoting its wall-clock share (`cProfile` magnifies call-heavy functions). Disclose if serialization or disk I/O is inside the timed loop.

### 3. Classify the Bottleneck

| Type | Signs | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU-bound** | High CPU, pure compute | Better algorithm, vectorization (NumPy/Polars), SIMD libraries, concurrency |
| **I/O-bound** | Waiting on net/disk/DB | Async (`asyncio`), batching, caching, connection pooling |
| **Memory-bound** | High RSS, GC pressure, OOM | `memray` flamegraph, generators, `@dataclass(slots=True)`, `memoryview` |
| **Lookup-table RSS** | Large dict survives load, RSS >> on-disk size | Compact trie (`marisa_trie`) or sorted byte arrays + `numpy.searchsorted` |
| **String/Scanner slicing** | Repeated `text[pos:]` copies in loops | Positional indexing (`re.Pattern.match(text, pos)`) and bounded lookahead |
| **Database** | Slow queries, N+1 queries | Indexes, query projection, batch fetching |
| **Algorithmic** | Scales poorly with `n` (`O(n²)`) | Hash lookups (`set`/`dict`), early exit, prefix trees |

### 4. Apply Fixes (in Order of Leverage)
1. **Better algorithm or data structure** (replace linear scan with `dict`/`set`, positional matching over slicing copies).
2. **Do less work** (`@functools.lru_cache`, column projection in Parquet scans, batching).
3. **Drop-in SIMD / Native Accelerators**:
   - JSON serialization: `orjson` (5x–10x faster than stdlib `json`).
   - Fuzzy matching: `rapidfuzz` (10x–50x faster than pure Python).
   - Large text search: `stringzilla` (SIMD AVX2/NEON).
   - Tabular data: `polars` / `duckdb` over Pandas (`polars-duckdb`).
   - Zero-copy slicing: `memoryview` and `bytearray`.
   - Object memory footprint: `@dataclass(slots=True)` (40–60% lower RAM than standard dicts/classes).
   - Large static lookup tables (`>1M` keys): Re-encode `dict[str, int]` (~100 B/entry in RSS) into `marisa_trie.BytesTrie` or sorted arrays + `numpy.searchsorted` (up to 25x RSS reduction with zero accuracy loss; always measure RSS in a fresh process).
4. **Concurrency or parallelism** when workload matches (`python-concurrency`).
5. **Rust native extension** (`pyo3-maturin`) last, only after Python options are exhausted.

### 5. Validate
Run the exact baseline benchmark on the same inputs, verify bit-for-bit or parity correctness, and confirm the speedup or RSS reduction justifies the added code complexity.

## Output Expectations
- Bottleneck diagnosis backed by profiler output
- Prioritized changes applied
- Before/after table (wall-clock latency, throughput, peak RSS in a fresh process)
- Explicit trade-offs

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Goal and numeric constraints defined
- [ ] Profiled before changing (`time.perf_counter`, `py-spy`/`cProfile`/`memray`)
- [ ] Bottleneck type classified
- [ ] Changes target the measured hotspot
- [ ] Re-measured in a clean process with correctness preserved
