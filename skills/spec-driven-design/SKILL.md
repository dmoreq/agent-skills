# Spec-Driven Design Skill

Move from an unproven idea to an owner-approved design spec before code exists.

## When to Use
- A feature request is vague, under-specified, or architecturally open.
- Several defensible designs exist and the owner must choose.
- The work needs a saved spec that a fresh implementer can execute without guessing.
- A concept needs adversarial review before it becomes a commitment.

## When Not to Use
- The change is mechanical, local, and fully specified.
- The work is implementation (`python-pro`, `rust-pro`) or merge review (`code-review`).
- The question is an external approach survey (`tech-research`).
- Codebase facts are unknown; ground them first with `codebase-contracts`.

## Artifact Paths
- Concepts brief: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD_concepts-brief_<topic>.md`. Topic and feature slugs follow the artifact slug and containment rule in `rules/AGENTS.md` §4.
- Approved spec: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD_<feature>.md`.
- Session fallback: the host artifact directory, or `.tmp/`, with the same date prefix.
- Never write an undated file at the repository root.

## Workflow

### 0. Intake
Read the predecessor artifact in this order: explicit path, concepts brief, discussion summary, then interactive chat. Confirm the parsed context with the owner before drafting.

### 1. Gate 1: Requirements and Architecture Lock
1. Drill the problem with one open-ended question per turn. Ask again until the problem statement, consumers, hard constraints, and out-of-scope boundaries are clear.
2. Stop on contradictory requests under the Contradiction Halt rule in `rules/AGENTS.md` §2.
3. When architectures diverge, apply Architecture Ownership: up to three options, no ranking, owner decides. Do not use structured question tools for open-ended exploration.
4. Summarize the anchored hypothesis in 2-3 sentences. Wait for explicit readiness confirmation before spawning reviewers.

### 2. Six-Lens Brainstorm Fan-Out
Dispatch one read-only Goldfish subagent per lens. Use the prompt cards in `references/spec-templates-and-standards.md`.

| Lens | Primary Challenge |
| :--- | :--- |
| Contrarian / YAGNI | Why must this exist? Can reuse solve 90%? |
| Cost / Quota / Token | Peak QPS, memory, storage, token budget |
| UX / Ergonomics | Is the interface intuitive and consistent? |
| Migration / Compatibility | Schema, client, and rollback safety |
| Observability / SRE | Can an on-call engineer debug this at 3 AM? |
| Maintenance / Coupling | Will this be a liability in two years? |

Dispatch by host capability:
- Tier 1, native parallel subagents: Antigravity `invoke_subagent`, Codex `spawn_agent`, OpenCode `Task`.
- Tier 2, sequential cold read: save the hypothesis to disk, then evaluate each lens card in order.

Pass only the lens card, the artifact path, and readable source paths. Never pass conversation history.

### 3. Compile the Concepts Brief
Deduplicate findings, group by severity (`Critical`, `Important`, `Suggestion`, `Nit`), and write the brief. Notify the owner with the path and the 2-3 strongest objections. Iterate until the concept survives review.

### 4. Draft the Spec
Write the spec against the template in `references/spec-templates-and-standards.md`.

- Split semantics: `FeatureRange` covers the problem, goals, architecture, alternatives, and CUJs. `DetailedRange` covers the implementation plan.
- Apply the Zero-Decision Rule on `DetailedRange`: name every file as Create, Modify, or Delete with a rationale, API shape, data flow, and test plan. No code.
- Apply the Alternatives Rule and the Heilmeier questions.
- Fill Critical User Journeys in Given / When / Then form.
- Write to disk. Do not dump the draft into chat.

### 5. Gate 2: Consolidated Review
1. Hand the spec to **doubt-driven-development** and run the five-lens Goldfish review across both ranges.
2. The owner resolves findings with `PROPOSE FIX`, `CONTEST`, `ESCALATE`, or `DECLINE` under the Checkable Contest Invariant.
3. Apply approved fixes, then re-check the semantic split before any later audit.

Default cadence is the two gates above. Pause section by section only when the owner explicitly asks.

## Rules
- One question per turn. Options must be action-oriented, with no `(Recommended)` prefix on architecture choices.
- Never present large drafts in chat. Write the artifact and link it.
- Plain English. No promotional adjectives, no flattery, no apologies.
- Reviewers are read-only and stateless. A same-context review is not a Goldfish review.
- Cap re-audits at one per stage and follow the spec/design review bound in `rules/AGENTS.md` §1.

## Related Skills
- Hand off the approved spec to **doubt-driven-development** for the consolidated five-lens review.
- Use **ux-product-shaper** when the approved spec needs information architecture, Surface Mode, and the 8-state contract.
- Use **python-patterns** for framework, layout, and ADR decisions inside the spec.
- Apply **code-minimalism** when the concept can be reduced to a smaller scope.
- Use **tech-research** when the alternatives require external evidence.
- Use **codebase-contracts** to ground the spec in current code and to publish contracts afterward.
