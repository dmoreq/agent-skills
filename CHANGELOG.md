### Changed
- `skills/doubt-driven-development`: Upgraded from a single-artifact prompt to the five-lens Goldfish review with semantic split, isolated dispatch, consolidated report, and `PROPOSE FIX` / `CONTEST` / `ESCALATE` / `DECLINE` reconciliation.
- `skills/code-minimalism`: Added Anti-Weeds (Altitude Control) and an explicit Root Cause versus Local Band-Aid rule.
- `skills/tech-research`: Added the handoff boundary to `spec-driven-design` and `technical-reporting`.
- `skills/technical-reporting`: Added spec, drift-report, and decision-lock handoffs; related skills raised to six.
- `skills/code-review`: Added the `codebase-contracts` drift check for documented behavior, explicit async-Rust review handoff, risk-based Goldfish dispatch, and the multi-agent reconciliation verdict.
- `skills/technical-reporting`, `data-visualization`, `plotly-dash`, `data-storytelling`, `algorithm-optimization`, and `code-review`: Added `html-report` handoffs and resolved the Markdown/HTML, static/server, and chart/report boundaries.
- `rules/AGENTS.md` and `README.md`: Documented single-file HTML report ownership and routing.
- All 26 skills: Completed the bidirectional `## Related Skills` graph with at least two inbound and two outbound handoffs per skill.

### Removed
- Hermes host support: deleted `rules/hermes-preamble.md`, `bots/seven-bots/`, and `tests/verify-profiles.sh`; removed Hermes detection, SOUL composition, host routing, and summary output from `setup.sh`.
- Hermes references from the spec, plan, and code-review dispatch contracts; those skills now use native parallel subagents or a sequential cold read.
- Hermes entries from `README.md` and the active test suite. Historical release notes remain unchanged.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added
- `rules/AGENTS.md`: Added mandatory **Subprocess & Memory Safety** rules under §4 Safety & Workspace Hygiene. Guards against out-of-memory (OOM) and machine freeze conditions via fail-fast small sampling (100–1,000 rows), line-by-line streaming/chunking, conservative concurrency bounds (`workers <= 4`), and strict execution timeouts.
- `setup.sh`: Added native ZCode Desktop support (`--host zcode`, `~/.zcode/AGENTS.md`, `~/.zcode/skills`).
- `tests/test_invariants.py`: Added automated AST complexity budget checks (`depth <= 3`) for all skill scripts, forbidden emoji/HTML tag detection across skills, and recursive internal reference validation.

### Changed & Hardened
- `skills/data-science/scripts/eda_profile.py`: Hardened bounded reading (stops scanning immediately once `--max-rows` is reached), flattened AST indentation nesting to `<= 2`, handled ragged CSV extra columns without crashing, and escaped pipe/newline characters in Markdown summary tables.
- `skills/verify-and-stop`: Replaced emoji bullets with standard Markdown formatting to enforce `rules/AGENTS.md` §1 (`Zero emojis`).
- `skills/code-minimalism`: Refactored to reference `rules/AGENTS.md` §2 directly and added concrete Anti-Bloat Heuristics table, eliminating micro-kernel rule restatement.
- `skills/code-review`: Fixed corrupted HTML tag and renumbered duplicate section numbers in `references/repo-snapshot-review.md`.
- `package.sh` & `.gitignore`: Cleaned stale zip archives before building, excluded `.ruff_cache/`, `.tmp/`, and `.scratch/` from distribution bundles, and added missing patterns to `.gitignore`.
- `setup.sh`: Extended OpenCode detection to check `~/.config/opencode` (XDG standard) and passed config paths to Python via `sys.argv` instead of inline string interpolation.

### Removed
- `setup.sh` & `README.md`: Safely deprecated and pruned discontinued coding agent host configurations and installation logic: Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Pi Agent, DeepSeek Harness, and Eigent Desktop.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-24

### Added
- `setup.sh`: Native Zed Editor integration (`--host zed`) installing global rules to `~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md` and discovering portable skills in `~/.agents/skills`; safely preserves existing user commit message rules.
- `bots`: Added bounded role templates and shared bot contract for agentic teams.
- `algorithm-optimization`: Extracted `references/query-suggestion-experiments.md` for pre-submission autocomplete experiments, synthetic prefix cohorts, and independent scorer parity gates.

- `algorithm-optimization`, `code-minimalism`, `deprecation-migration`, `python-pro`, `python-concurrency`: Enforced strict Progressive Disclosure (`<= 250` lines and `<= 12 KB` per `SKILL.md`), purging session-specific literals while preserving domain playbooks in `references/`.
- `python-performance` & `python-testing`: Standardized `resources/implementation-playbook.md` into `references/implementation-playbook.md` across all skills.
- `tests/test_invariants.py` & `tests/test_skills_schema.py`: Fixed hardcoded skill-tuple blind spot in `test_cross_skill_references_exist`, added file-existence verification for all `references/` and `scripts/` paths, and enforced Progressive Disclosure line/byte caps for the 23-skill catalog.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-16
